# The Go Engineer's Guide to Machine Learning

Welcome! This guide is for Go engineers who want to learn about machine learning. Machine learning is a growing field with many exciting applications. As a Go engineer, you have the unique opportunity to apply your skills to this rapidly growing field.

This guide will teach you the basics of machine learning, including how to train and use models. You'll also learn about some of the challenges that come with working with machine learning models. By the end of this guide, you'll be ready to start applying machine learning to your own projects.

So let's get started!

## What is Machine Learning?

Machine learning is a field of computer science that enables computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. In other words, machine learning allows computers to automatically improve their performance on a task by learning from experience.

There are two main types of machine learning: supervised and unsupervised. Supervised learning is where the computer is given a set of training data, and the desired output for that data, and the computer learns to generalize from the training data to produce the desired output for new data. Unsupervised learning is where the computer is given data but not told what the desired output is, and it has to learn to find structure in the data itself.

## Why Should I Learn Machine Learning?

Machine learning is a rapidly growing field with many exciting applications. It's being used to build self-driving cars, to create more realistic computer graphics, and to power virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa. As a Go engineer, you have the unique opportunity to apply your skills to this rapidly growing field.

## How Do I Learn Machine Learning?

The best way to learn machine learning is to dive in and start building models. There are many resources available to help you get started, including online courses, books, and blog posts.
